# Socio-Marketo

Socio-Marketo is a decentralized social media platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide users with ownership and authenticity of their content. This repository contains the codebase for Socio-Marketo, including the smart contracts, web application built with Next.js, and mobile application built with Expo React Native.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/smart_contracts**: Contains the Solidity smart contracts for Socio-Marketo.
- **/web**: Contains the web application frontend code, developed using Next.js.
- **/mobile**: Contains the mobile application frontend code, developed using Expo React Native.
- **/jupyter_notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and research related to Socio-Marketo.

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. They govern the core functionality of Socio-Marketo, including tokenization of user-generated posts as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), user authentication, and content verification.

## Web Application
